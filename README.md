# ChessGame

## Todo
- ~~Render a Chess Board~~
  - ~~Make Board resizable~~
- ~~Show chess pieces~~
  - ~~Add animation to pieces movement~~
- Add Arrows/Circles animations - I haven't had the time to do it, but I'd go with a simillar approach to how I did with the tiles animations. An Animated.View rendered with position absolute and a Manager class adding/removing elements and setting its positions;
- ~~Test your solution~~
 - For time reason did not add test to all components (specially those related to the animations). But I did add a good coverage of tests on tile rendering and the board rendering.
